# TODO

## Missing Features / Next Steps

- **Premium subscription feature** — The `premiumPlans` and `premiumSubscription` tables exist in the schema but no commands or logic use them. Either implement the feature or remove the dead schema to avoid confusion.


- **Auto-deploy commands on startup** — Instead of a manual `npm run commands` step, compare a hash of the local serialized command definitions against what Discord currently has registered and only call `PUT applicationCommands` when they differ. Discord rate-limits global command updates to 200/day per app, so change-detection is necessary before enabling this.


- **Per-channel tracking** — The `channelTracking` table and `trackvoice-all` command suggest per-channel opt-in was planned but only `trackAll` is implemented. The per-channel enable/disable flow is incomplete.



## Premium Features

_Free tier baseline is defined in `src/helpers/logCleanup.ts`. Premium upgrades slot in by reading per-guild overrides from the DB._

- **Extended log retention** — Free tier retains 30 days (`FREE_TIER_RETENTION_DAYS`). Premium guilds get a longer window. Requires adding `logRetentionDays` integer (nullable) to the `guild` table (see Pending DB Changes), then changing the cleanup loop to read `retentionDays ?? FREE_TIER_RETENTION_DAYS` per guild.

## Pending DB Changes

_Batch these together and run `dzz-generate` + `dzz-migrate` once there are enough to justify a migration._

- **`src/db/schema.ts` `guild`** — Add `logRetentionDays: integer("logRetentionDays")` (nullable). Null means free tier; premium guilds get a value set here. Required before the log cleanup can respect per-guild retention windows.

- **`src/db/schema.ts` `channelTracking`** — Remove redundant `index("voicetrack_guildId_idx")`; the unique index already covers the column.

## Completed

- **Removed `DeleteCommands.ts`** — `PUT applicationCommands` with a full body replaces commands atomically; delete step was redundant. Script deleted, `commands` script in `package.json` updated.
- **Replaced `require()` with `await import()`** — all 6 command files converted to named exports (`export const data`, `export async function execute`); `commandsCreate.ts` made async; `DeployCommands.ts` loop moved inside async IIFE; `Bot.ts` startup wrapped in async IIFE to await `commandsCreate`.
- **`/trackvoice-disable` fix** — `trackVoice.ts` now checks `getVoiceTrack.trackAll` in both `oneChannelBehavior` and `twoChannelBehavior`; disabling tracking actually stops the bot from posting.
- **Removed unused `GuildPresences` privileged intent** — dropped from `Bot.ts`; no longer blocks scaling past 100 servers without Discord verification.
- **Rate limiter cleanup no longer logs in production** — changed `printWarn(true, ...)` to `printDev(...)` in `rateLimiter.ts`; import updated accordingly.
- **Log retention cleanup** — Added `src/helpers/logCleanup.ts`; runs on startup then every 24 h. Deletes log rows older than 30 days per guild (`FREE_TIER_RETENTION_DAYS`). Structured per-guild so extending to premium retention later requires only adding the `logRetentionDays` column and a one-line change in the cleanup loop.

- **Full dependency update pass** — bumped all deps: discord.js 14.20→14.26.4, drizzle-orm 0.44→0.45, drizzle-kit 0.18→0.31 (now compatible with drizzle-orm and the `dialect`/`url` config shape), typescript 5.8→6.0, eslint 9→10, tsx 4.20→4.22, and all other dev deps.
- **`DATABASE_URL` consolidation** — removed individual `DZZ_HOST/PORT/USER/PASSWORD/DATABASE` env vars from `.env.example`, `drizzle.config.ts`, and `src/types/env.d.ts`; both the bot runtime and Drizzle Kit now share the single `DATABASE_URL` connection string.
- **ESLint flat config migration** — replaced legacy `.eslintrc.cjs` with `eslint.config.cjs` (ESLint 9+ flat config); `.cjs` files excluded from linting. Added `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` scripts to `package.json`.
- **`clientReady` rename** — `src/Bot.ts` `bot.on("ready", ...)` updated to `"clientReady"` per discord.js v14 deprecation ahead of v15.
- **Rate limiting for commands** — Added `src/helpers/rateLimiter.ts` with sliding-window rate limits (2 cmd/s per `guildId:userId`, 10 cmd/s per guild); checked in `commandsEvent.ts` before dispatch, replies ephemerally with remaining wait time. Cleanup scheduler supports a fixed clock hour (`RATE_LIMIT_CLEANUP_HOUR`) or an interval (`RATE_LIMIT_CLEANUP_HOURS`, default 24 h).
- **Graceful shutdown** — Added `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` handlers in `src/Bot.ts`; exported `sql` pool from `db/client.ts` so both the Discord client and DB connection close cleanly on shutdown.
- **`/status` command** — Added `src/commands/info/status.ts`; Administrator-only, ephemeral reply with bot online status, WebSocket ping, and DB connectivity.
- **Dockerfile production build** — Added `prod` script (`tsx src/Bot.ts`, no `--watch`); updated `CMD` to use it instead of `npm start`.

- **`src/db/ignoreUsers.ts`** — Extracted `addIgnoredUser(guildId, userId)` and `removeIgnoredUser(guildId, userId)` helpers; updated `ignoreuser.ts` and `unignoreuser.ts` to use them.
- **`src/types/ClientType.d.ts`** — Defined `Command` interface (`{ data: SlashCommandBuilder; execute: (interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction) => Promise<void> }`); `commands` collection now typed as `Collection<string, Command>`.
- **`src/events/commandsCreate.ts`** — Added comment documenting that `.ts` filter is intentional since `tsx` is the only runtime.
- **`src/events/trackVoice.ts`** — Rewrote unclear comment on cross-guild transitions.

- **`Dockerfile`** — Removed `ARG`/`ENV` lines for `BOT_TOKEN`, `APP_ID`, `DATABASE_URL`; secrets are now injected at runtime by CapRover.
- **`src/Bot.ts`** — Added startup validation: checks all required env vars are non-empty and calls `process.exit(1)` with a clear message if any are missing.
- **`src/commands/trackvoice/ignoreuser.ts`** — Added regex guard (`/^\d{17,20}$/`) on `user.id` before writing to the database.
- **`src/db/schema.ts` `ignoreUsers`** — Changed from `varchar` to `text[]`; updated `ignoreuser.ts` and `unignoreuser.ts` to use array operations. Migration applied to live DB.

- **`src/commands/mod/clear.ts`** — Removed dead `isNaN(amount)` guard; added missing `return` after range-check reply.
- **`src/events/trackVoice.ts`** — Replaced inverted mute/deaf/video early-returns with a single guard that only skips when neither channel nor streaming changed.
- **`src/db/client.ts`** — Raised connection pool from `max: 1` to `max: 10`.
- **`src/commands/trackvoice/disable.ts`** — Added null guard on `trackUpdate` before accessing `.trackAll`.
- **`.env.example`** — Fixed `DZZ_PORT` from `3306` (MySQL) to `5432` (PostgreSQL).
- **`src/Bot.ts`** — Added `.catch()` to `bot.login()` with `process.exit(1)` on failure.
- **`src/db/migrate.ts`** — Wrapped migration in `.catch()` with `process.exit(1)` on failure.
- **`src/events/trackVoice.ts`** — Wrapped both `bot.channels.fetch()` calls in try/catch; added top-level try/catch in the event handler (with helper calls now properly awaited).
- **`src/events/commandsEvent.ts`** — Wrapped the catch body's `reply()`/`followUp()` in its own try/catch.
- **`src/events/commandsCreate.ts`** — Wrapped `require(filePath)` in try/catch to prevent a broken command from crashing the load loop; switched warning to `console.warn`.
- **`src/events/guildCreate.ts` / `guildDelete.ts`** — Switched catch handlers from `console.log` to `console.error`.
- **All command catch blocks** (`all.ts`, `disable.ts`, `ignoreuser.ts`, `unignoreuser.ts`, `clear.ts`) — Switched to `console.error`; wrapped error reply calls in their own try/catch.
- **Inconsistent logging** — All logs now route through `printDev(...args)`, `printWarn(force, ...args)`, and `printError(force, ...args)` in `src/helpers/functions.ts`. Startup/script errors use `force: true`; runtime handler errors use `force: false`.
